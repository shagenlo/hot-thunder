Game development repository.

This game is a multi-user, place-based game meant to take place in a fun, learning environment.  There are two roles which participate in this game, players and a game operator.  Both players and users are presumed to use a mobile device, though they are perfectly welcome to use a web browser.  A third role, controlled by the operator is a passive displa (computer webbrowser in full-screen mode) connected to a projector.  All of these devices are connected in a real-time fashion utilizing the real-time capabilities of the Firebase database system.
